The solutions here were written by my school's team as solutions for the 2017 K-State Beginner Programming Competition. 
We tied for first place out of twenty-two teams. 
Our solution for problem six was finished after the competition as none of the teams were able to provide a solution in the given time.  
  
The competition info can be found [here](http://www.cs.ksu.edu/hspc/). The problems for which this repository holds the solutions can be found [here](http://www.cs.ksu.edu/hspc/Beginner%20Problems%201-6.pdf) (PDF).
